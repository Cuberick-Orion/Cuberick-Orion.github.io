#### Research Summary

I am currently working on:

- video generative / video editing models.

Previously, I have researched on:

- multi-modal learning, in particular, vision-and-language tasks;
- weakly-supervised learning.

I maintain my publication record at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2lWQHxIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
Source code for all first-author projects are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/Cuberick-Orion).
