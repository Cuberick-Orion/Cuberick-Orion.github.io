I am a research fellow at the [Centre for Augmented Reasoning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/car), Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML) at the University of Adelaide, working with [Prof. Anton Van Den Hengel](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/anton.vandenhengel). My current research focuses on generative model, especially music generation, and multi-modal learning.
