I obtained my PhD from the Australian National University in 2024, advised by [Prof. Stephen Gould](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sgould/) and [Dr. Damien Teney](https://www.damienteney.info/) (Idiap Research Institute | AIML). My PhD surrounds multi-modal learning, in particular, vision-and-language, where I focused on a task termed [composed image retrieval](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cirr).

<!-- Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor degree in Electronics Engineering (R&D) with first-class honours from the Australian National University in 2018. -->
